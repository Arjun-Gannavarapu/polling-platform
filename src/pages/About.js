      <p>Creating a voting platform for various matters can be a complex and multi-step project, often involving back-end development, user authentication, and a database. Below, I'll provide a simplified outline of how you can structure such a voting platform in React.

Front-end Components:

Authentication:
You'll need user authentication for voters to sign in and cast their votes. You can use third-party libraries like Firebase, Auth0, or implement your custom authentication system.

Dashboard:
Create a dashboard that displays a list of matters or issues to be voted on. Each matter could have a title, description, and voting options.

Matter Details:
When a user clicks on a matter, they should be directed to a page displaying the details of the matter, including its description and a list of voting options.

Voting Component:
Create a component that allows users to cast their votes. Each voting option can be represented as a button, and users can select one option. This component should also handle user input validation and submission.

Results Page:
After voting, users can see the results of the matter, showing the total votes for each option.

Back-end (Not covered in detail):

Database:
Set up a database to store matters, voting options, and user data.

API:
Create an API that communicates between the front-end and the database. The API should handle user authentication, matter retrieval, voting, and result updates.

Example Code Structure:

Below is a simplified example of how you can structure your React components. In a real application, you would need to integrate a back end.</p>
